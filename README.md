The investments we all wish we made if we only knew then what everyone knows now!!!!!!!
The input boxes contain a list of a few popular stock tickers that can be added, but it will accept any ticker symbol listed on finance. 
This simple app just gives the user an idea of how much they would have if they invested in a given stock over a period of time. This can be very useful combined with a
