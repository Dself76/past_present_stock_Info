The investments we all wish we made if we only knew then what everyone knows now!!!!!!!
There is  list of a few popular stock tickers that can be added on the right hand side,  but it will accept any ticker symbol listed on yfinance. 
This simple app just gives the user an idea of how much they would have if they invested in a given stock over a period of time. This can be very useful combined with a
